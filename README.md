# Aka

A command-line pomodoro client for the mac, written in elixir.

Where did the name come from?  The idea for the
[Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com) technique came from the idea of an
kitchen timer that looked like a red tomato.  Aka is the Japanese word for
red... It's short, so it's easy to type from a CLI, and it's a way to give
pay homage to all the other Japanese concepts that make the idea of deveopment
flow so much more meaningful.
